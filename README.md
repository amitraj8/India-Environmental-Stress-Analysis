# Environmental Stress and Public Climate Attention in India
A Multi-Dimensional State-Level Data Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains the code, data, and final academic paper for my research on the intersection of physical pollution, digital youth advocacy, and environmental public policy in India. 

The study mathematically proves that while highly populated industrial states dominate the digital climate narrative (Google Trends), national financial diplomacy (NAFCC adaptation funds) equitably bypasses digital pressure to protect highly vulnerable, low-population ecological zones.

## Project Structure
* **`/data`**: Contains the raw datasets (AQI, CEPI, Plastic Waste, NAFCC Funding, and Google Trends).
* **`/notebooks`**: Contains the Python/Jupyter notebook (`Pollution.ipynb`) used for data cleaning, calculating the Composite Environmental Stress Index (CESI), and generating correlations.
* **`/images`**: Contains the exported data visualizations and correlation matrices.
* **`/paper`**: Contains the final compiled PDF and the LaTeX source code.

## Key Findings
1. **The Physical Baseline:** Plastic waste shows a severe upward trajectory, while industrial and atmospheric pollution remain geographically clustered. 
2. **The Digital Outcry:** There is a strong positive correlation (0.49) between physical air pollution spikes and digital searches for "air pollution," proving the internet acts as a real-time thermometer for public anxiety.
3. **The Policy Plot Twist:** There is a negative correlation (-0.14) between digital outcry and climate funding per capita. The government prioritizes quiet, ecologically fragile states (like the North-East) over loud, highly populated digital centers.

## Tools Used
* **Python** (Pandas, Pytrends) for data manipulation and correlation analysis.
* **Jupyter Notebook** for exploratory data analysis.
* **LaTeX** for professional academic typesetting.
